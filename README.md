# ChoiceScript VSCode README

This is a syntax highlighter extension for the interactive fiction/multiple choice language, ChoiceScript.

## Features

* Syntax highlighting for ChoiceScript, including variables, commands, comments, etc.

## Requirements

None as of now, though as this extension only adds syntax highlighting, you will need to set up the ChoiceScript project structure yourself.

As of now, it defaults to any file with a txt extension. However, as the commands are very specific to ChoiceScript, it isn't likely this will highlight anything in a non-ChoiceScript file! That is, unless, you write crazy things like *comment in your text files...
