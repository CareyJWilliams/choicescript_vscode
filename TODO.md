# TODO

- Error on mixed tabs and spaces
- Flag a missing line in an *if/*elseif/*else block (must have at least one line)
- Add user-settable options for warnings
- Investigate syntax highlighting from the plugin itself
- Don't use the Variable token type to indicate "I don't know this token's contents"
- Warn about use of ${} in expressions where it isn't allowed
- "@{fake_var }" should trigger a problem with "fake_var" even though the multireplace isn't complete.
